# ECDC data

ESAC-Net antibiotic use data were scraped from the [CDC
website](https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/antimicrobial-consumption/database/distribution-by-antimicrobial-group)
into `esac.tsv`.

EARS-Net antibiotic resistance were downloaded from the [CDC
website](https://atlas.ecdc.europa.eu/public/index.aspx) as a single csv file.

The R script `raw/clean_data.R` cleans the downloaded data to create
`ecdc_data.tsv`.
